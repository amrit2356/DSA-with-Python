    "# BackTracking Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking is a technique used to solve problems by incrementally building candidates for the solution and abandoning a candidate (\"backtrack\") as soon as it is determined that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution. It's a brute-force algorithmic technique that systematically searches for a solution to a computational problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how backtracking works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose a Starting Point**: Start with an empty solution and begin building it incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Make a Decision**: Make a decision to choose one of the possible candidates for the next extension of the current partial solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify if the Candidate is Valid**: Check if the chosen candidate leads to a valid solution. If it does not, backtrack and try another candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **If Valid Solution Found, Return**: If the candidate leads to a valid solution, return it. If not, backtrack and try another candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Repeat Steps 2-4 Until Solution is Found or All Candidates are Tried**: Keep repeating the process until a valid solution is found or until all possible candidates have been tried.\n",

    "**Safety Conditions Code**:\n",
    "1. No Other Queen in the Same Row to the Left:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This condition checks if there are any queens already placed in the same row to the left of the current position being considered.\n",
    "    It iterates over the columns to the left of the current column (col) and checks if there's a queen in any of those columns in the same row (board[row][i] == 1).\n",
    "    - No Other Queen in the Upper Diagonal on the Left Side:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For the upper diagonal, it checks if there are any queens already placed in the diagonally upward direction to the left of the current position.\n",
    "    - It iterates over both rows and columns, moving diagonally upwards to the left from the current position ((row, col)), checking if there's a queen (board[i][j] == 1) in any of those positions.\n",
    "    - No Other Queen in the Lower Diagonal on the Left Side:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For the lower diagonal, it checks if there are any queens already placed in the diagonally downward direction to the left of the current position.\n",
    "    - Similar to the upper diagonal check, it iterates over both rows and columns, moving diagonally downwards to the left from the current position, checking if there's a queen (board[i][j] == 1) in any of those positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms:\n",
    "- Same Row Check: It ensures there are no queens in the same row to the left, as queens can move horizontally.\n",
    "- Upper Diagonal Check: It ensures there are no queens diagonally upwards to the left, as queens can move diagonally upwards.\n",
    "- Lower Diagonal Check: It ensures there are no queens diagonally downwards to the left, as queens can move diagonally downwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recursive Implementation**:\n",
    "1. Select a starting point to add the queen(1).(In case of N Queen problem, we choose the left most corner).\n",
    "2. Check if all the conditions are met(which they will, since its the first change in the matrix).\n",
    "3. Go to next column, add a queen(1) and check if all safety conditions are met.\n",
    "- False: remove queen(1) and goto next row. \n",
    "- True: add queen(1) in that row.\n",
    "- if queen cannot be placed in all the rows of a column, \"backtrack\" and remove queen from previous column and move to the next row and recheck safety. Keep backtracking till first column.\n",
    "4. Follow step (3) for all columns till all queens can be placed safely.\n"

    "- **Exponential Time Complexity:** Most backtracking algorithms have exponential time complexity in the worst case. Therefore, if you're dealing with a problem where the number of candidate solutions grows exponentially with the size of the problem (e.g., N-Queens, Subset Sum), expect exponential time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Branching Factor and Depth:** Analyze the problem to understand the branching factor (the number of choices at each decision point) and the depth of the recursion (typically equal to the size of the problem). If the branching factor is large or the recursion depth is deep, expect longer execution times.\n",

    "- **Additional Space:** Consider any additional space required to store the current partial solution or any auxiliary data structures used during the backtracking process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rule of Thumb:\n",
    "- **Exponential Time, Linear Space:** As a general rule, expect backtracking algorithms to have exponential time complexity and linear space complexity.\n",

    "## Code Solutions:\n",
    "### 1. Sudoku Solver\n",
    "1. **Class Definition and Method**:\n",
    "   - The `Solution` class contains a method `solveSudoku` which takes a 9x9 Sudoku board represented as a list of lists of strings (`List[List[str]]`) as input.\n",
    "   - `n` is set to 9, representing the size of the Sudoku board.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **isValid Function**:\n",
    "   - The `isValid` function checks if it's valid to place the character `ch` at position `(row, col)` on the Sudoku board.\n",
    "   - It checks three conditions:\n",
    "     - No other occurrence of `ch` in the same column.\n",
    "     - No other occurrence of `ch` in the same row.\n",
    "     - No other occurrence of `ch` in the same 3x3 subgrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **solve Function (Backtracking)**:\n",
    "   - The `solve` function is a recursive backtracking function that tries to solve the Sudoku puzzle.\n",
    "   - It starts by considering each cell `(row, col)` on the board.\n",
    "   - If the cell is empty (denoted by `\".\"`), it tries placing digits from 1 to 9 in that cell and recursively solves the rest of the puzzle.\n",
    "   - If placing a digit leads to a valid solution, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it backtracks and tries a different digit.\n",
    "   - If the cell is already filled, it moves to the next cell.\n",
    "   - The function returns `True` if a solution is found, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Solving the Sudoku Puzzle**:\n",
    "   - Finally, the `solve` function is called with the starting cell `(0, 0)` to begin the backtracking process and solve the Sudoku puzzle.\n"
