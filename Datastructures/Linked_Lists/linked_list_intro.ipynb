    "# Linked Lists \n",
    "Linked lists are fundamental data structures used to store sequences of elements. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation and are useful for dynamic data where elements are added and removed frequently. Let's dive into the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data:** The value or information of the node.\n",
    "- **Next:** A reference to the next node in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first node is called the **head** of the list. If a node's next reference is None, it's the last node, or **tail**, of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Linked Lists\n",
    "- **Singly Linked List:** Each node has only one reference to the next node.\n",
    "- **Doubly Linked List:** Each node has two references, one to the previous node and one to the next node.\n",
    "- **Circular Linked List:** The tail's next reference points back to the head, creating a circular structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Operations of Linked List:\n",
    "1. **Insertion:**\n",
    "    - At the beginning: Insert a new node and update the head.\n",
    "    - At the end: Traverse to the end and add the new node.\n",
    "2. **Deletion:**\n",
    "    - By key: Find the node with the specified value and remove it from the list.\n",
    "3. **Traversal:**\n",
    "    - Iterate through the list to access or print all elements.\n",
    "4. **Searching:**\n",
    "    - Search for a node with a specific value.\n",

    "1. **Singly Linked List:**\n",
    "    - **Structure:** Each node has a next pointer that points to the next node in the sequence. The head node represents the start of the list, and the last node's next pointer is None.\n",
    "    - **Traversal:** Can only be traversed in one direction, from head to tail.\n",
    "    - **Operations:** Insertion and deletion require traversing the list, especially when inserting at the end or deleting a specific node.\n",

    "    - **Structure:** Each node has both a next pointer pointing to the next node and a prev pointer pointing to the previous node. The head represents the start, and the tail is the last node, where next is None.\n",
    "    - **Traversal:** Can be traversed in both directions, from head to tail and vice versa.\n",
    "    - **Operations:** Easier insertion and deletion because nodes have references to both previous and next nodes.\n",

    "    - **Structure:** This list can be either singly or doubly linked, but the key characteristic is that the last node's next pointer points back to the head, forming a circular structure.\n",
    "    - **Traversal:** Requires care to avoid infinite loops because there's no clear end; traversal often stops when the node references come back to the head.\n",
